- [NEW] Automatic HTML escaping of output via an Escaper object (and related
  classes); use __raw() for raw values.

- [CHG] All helper functions now assume inputs are pre-escaped, or wrapped in
  an Escaper object

- [CHG] Helper\AbstractHelper::attribs() and Helper\Attribs::__invoke() now
  have a $skip param, allowing you to skip over certain attributes when
  building them.

- [BRK] Remove TwoStep::setInnerData() and setOuterData(), in favor of a
  single setData() method that sets data once for both inner and outer
  templates.

- [BRK] Helper\Styles::add() method now has $attribs second and $pos last, for
  consistency with all other helpers.

- [CHG] PSR-1/2 compliance
