- [FIX] In scripts/instance.php, pass an EscaperFactory.

- [FIX] #15: https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View/issues/15

- [CHG] TemplateFinder now uses is_readable() instead of SplFileObject, to
  help with testing using streams.
  
- [CHG] Renamed protected method TemplateFinder::fileExists() to exists(),
  because streams may not be files proper.
